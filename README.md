- 🔄 **Step Tracking**: Tracks and reports individual test steps with timing and status
- 📎 **Attachment Support**: Handles screenshots, videos, and other test attachments
- 🔌 **gRPC Integration**: Communicates with Stanterprise backend via gRPC protocol
- ⚙️ **Configurable**: Supports environment variables and configuration options
- 🛡️ **Error Resilient**: Graceful error handling that doesn't interrupt test execution

## Installation

```bash
npm install @stanterprise/playwright-reporter --save-dev
```

## Configuration

### Basic Setup

Add the reporter to your `playwright.config.ts`:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from "@playwright/test";

export default defineConfig({
  reporter: [["@stanterprise/playwright-reporter"]],
  // ... other config
});
```

### Advanced Configuration

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from "@playwright/test";

export default defineConfig({
  reporter: [
    [
      "@stanterprise/playwright-reporter",
      {
        grpcAddress: "localhost:50051", // gRPC server address
        grpcEnabled: true, // Enable/disable gRPC reporting
        grpcTimeout: 1000, // Timeout for gRPC calls in milliseconds
        grpcMaxMessageSize: 104857600, // Max message size (100MB default)
        maxAttachmentSize: 10485760, // Max attachment size (10MB default)
        verbose: false, // Enable verbose logging
      },
    ],
  ],
  // ... other config
});
```

### Environment Variables

You can also configure the reporter using environment variables:

- `STANTERPRISE_GRPC_ADDRESS`: gRPC server address (default: `localhost:50051`)
- `STANTERPRISE_GRPC_ENABLED`: Enable/disable gRPC reporting (default: `true`)
- `STANTERPRISE_META_*`: Custom metadata fields for test runs (prefix will be stripped)

#### Custom Metadata

Any environment variable with the `STANTERPRISE_META_` prefix will be automatically included in the test run metadata. The prefix is stripped from the key name.

For example:

- `STANTERPRISE_META_BUILD_ID=12345` becomes `BUILD_ID: 12345` in metadata
- `STANTERPRISE_META_BRANCH=main` becomes `BRANCH: main` in metadata
- `STANTERPRISE_META_COMMIT_SHA=abc123` becomes `COMMIT_SHA: abc123` in metadata

Example:

```bash
STANTERPRISE_GRPC_ADDRESS=myserver.com:50051 \
STANTERPRISE_META_BUILD_ID=12345 \
STANTERPRISE_META_BRANCH=main \
npx playwright test
```

## Configuration Options

| Option               | Type    | Default           | Description                                         |
| -------------------- | ------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `grpcAddress`        | string  | `localhost:50051` | gRPC server address                                 |
| `grpcEnabled`        | boolean | `true`            | Enable/disable gRPC reporting                       |
| `grpcTimeout`        | number  | `1000`            | Timeout for gRPC calls in milliseconds              |
| `grpcMaxMessageSize` | number  | `104857600`       | Max message size in bytes (100MB default)           |
| `maxAttachmentSize`  | number  | `10485760`        | Max attachment content size in bytes (10MB default) |
| `verbose`            | boolean | `false`           | Enable verbose logging                              |
| `grpcMaxRetries`     | number  | `3`               | Maximum number of retry attempts for failed gRPC calls  |
| `grpcRetryDelay`     | number  | `100`             | Initial delay for retries in ms (uses exponential backoff) |

### Retry Configuration

The reporter automatically retries failed gRPC calls for transient errors using exponential backoff:

- **Retryable errors**: `UNAVAILABLE`, `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`, `INTERNAL`, `UNKNOWN`
- **Non-retryable errors**: `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, `NOT_FOUND`, `PERMISSION_DENIED`, `UNAUTHENTICATED`, `ALREADY_EXISTS`

**Exponential backoff formula**: `grpcRetryDelay * (2 ^ attemptNumber)`

Example with default settings (`grpcRetryDelay: 100`, `grpcMaxRetries: 3`):
- Initial attempt: Immediate
- Retry 1: Wait 100ms (100 * 2^0)
- Retry 2: Wait 200ms (100 * 2^1)
- Retry 3: Wait 400ms (100 * 2^2)

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  reporter: [
    [
      "stanterprise-playwright-reporter",
      {
        grpcMaxRetries: 5,        // Try up to 5 times
        grpcRetryDelay: 200,      // Start with 200ms delay
        verbose: true,            // Log retry attempts
      },
    ],
  ],
});
```

To disable retries:

```typescript
{
  grpcMaxRetries: 0  // No retries, fail fast
}
```

## Sharding Support

The reporter automatically detects and reports when tests are running in sharded mode. When sharding is configured, the reporter includes the following metadata in test run events:

- `shard.current`: The current shard number (1-based)
- `shard.total`: The total number of shards

### Configuring Sharding

In your `playwright.config.ts`:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from "@playwright/test";

export default defineConfig({
  shard: { total: 5, current: 1 },
  reporter: [["stanterprise-playwright-reporter"]],
});
```

Or via CLI:

```bash
npx playwright test --shard=1/5
npx playwright test --shard=2/5
# ... etc
```

### Aggregating Results Across Shards

**Important:** To have a complete set of tests accumulated in the observability server, you must specify the same `STANTERPRISE_RUN_ID` environment variable for all shards. This ensures that results from all shards are associated with the same test run.

```bash
# Set the same run ID for all shards
export STANTERPRISE_RUN_ID="my-test-run-123"

# Run all shards with the same run ID
npx playwright test --shard=1/5
npx playwright test --shard=2/5
npx playwright test --shard=3/5
npx playwright test --shard=4/5
npx playwright test --shard=5/5
```

In CI/CD environments, you can use a unique identifier from your CI system:

```bash
# GitHub Actions example
STANTERPRISE_RUN_ID="${GITHUB_RUN_ID}" npx playwright test --shard=1/5

# GitLab CI example
STANTERPRISE_RUN_ID="${CI_PIPELINE_ID}" npx playwright test --shard=1/5

# Jenkins example
STANTERPRISE_RUN_ID="${BUILD_ID}" npx playwright test --shard=1/5
```

Without a shared `STANTERPRISE_RUN_ID`, each shard will generate its own unique run ID, and the results will be reported as separate test runs rather than a single aggregated run.

The shard information is automatically included in the metadata sent to the server, allowing you to:

- Track which tests ran on which shard
- Aggregate results from multiple shards
- Debug shard-specific issues

When verbose logging is enabled, you'll see shard information in the console output:

```
Stanterprise Reporter: Test run started with ID: 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000
Number of tests: 42
Run started at: 2026-01-25T10:30:00.000Z
Shard: 1 of 5
```

## What Gets Reported

### Test Events

- **Test Begin**: When a test starts
- **Test End**: When a test completes with status (passed/failed/skipped/timedOut)
- **Test Failure**: Detailed failure information including error messages and stack traces

### Step Events

- **Step Begin**: When a test step starts
- **Step End**: When a test step completes with duration and status

### Attachments

The reporter automatically processes and sends:

- Screenshots
- Videos
- Trace files
- Any other attachments captured during test execution

## Usage Example

```typescript
// playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "@playwright/test";

export default defineConfig({
  use: {
    screenshot: "only-on-failure",
    video: "retain-on-failure",
  },
  reporter: [
    ["list"], // Also show in console
    [
      "stanterprise-playwright-reporter",
      {
        grpcAddress: process.env.STANTERPRISE_GRPC_ADDRESS || "localhost:50051",
        verbose: process.env.CI === "true",
      },
    ],
  ],
});
```

## API

### StanterpriseReporter

Main reporter class implementing Playwright's `Reporter` interface.

```typescript
import { StanterpriseReporter } from "stanterprise-playwright-reporter";

const reporter = new StanterpriseReporter({
  grpcAddress: "localhost:50051",
  grpcEnabled: true,
  grpcTimeout: 1000,
  grpcMaxMessageSize: 104857600, // 100MB
  maxAttachmentSize: 10485760, // 10MB
  verbose: false,
});
```

### Types

```typescript
import type {
  StanterpriseReporterOptions,
  TestExecutionContext,
  StepExecutionContext,
} from "stanterprise-playwright-reporter";
```

## Development

### Building

```bash
npm run build
```

### Testing

```bash
npm test
```

### Cleaning

```bash
npm run clean
```

## How It Works

1. **Test Run Initialization**: When tests start, the reporter generates a unique run ID and establishes a gRPC connection
2. **Event Reporting**: As tests execute, the reporter sends events to the Stanterprise backend via gRPC
3. **Fire-and-Forget**: Events are sent asynchronously to avoid slowing down test execution
4. **Error Handling**: Connection errors are logged once and further attempts are disabled for that run
5. **Cleanup**: When tests complete, the gRPC connection is properly closed

## Architecture

The reporter is organized into several modules:

- **reporter.ts**: Main reporter implementation
- **types.ts**: TypeScript type definitions and interfaces
- **utils/statusMapper.ts**: Maps Playwright statuses to protobuf enums
- **utils/attachmentProcessor.ts**: Processes test attachments
- **utils/timeHelpers.ts**: Handles timestamp and duration conversions

## Troubleshooting

### gRPC Error 13 INTERNAL: failed to publish event

This error typically occurs due to one of two issues:

**1. Metadata Serialization (Most Common)**

If you see this error with the stack trace mentioning "metadata is not iterable" or serialization issues, it was a bug in v0.0.13 and earlier versions. **Solution: Upgrade to v0.0.14 or later.**

**2. Large Attachments**

This error can also occur when test event payloads exceed the gRPC message size limit. Common causes:

1. **Large attachments**: Tests with large screenshots, videos, or trace files
2. **Default size limits**: gRPC has a default 4MB message size limit

**Solutions:**

1. **Increase message size limits** (recommended):

   ```typescript
   reporter: [
     [
       "stanterprise-playwright-reporter",
       {
         grpcMaxMessageSize: 104857600, // 100MB (default)
         maxAttachmentSize: 10485760,   // 10MB (default)
       },
     ],
   ],
   ```

2. **Reduce attachment sizes**:
   - Configure Playwright to save attachments to disk instead of embedding them
   - The reporter automatically uses file paths when available instead of content

   ```typescript
   use: {
     screenshot: "only-on-failure",
     video: "retain-on-failure",
     trace: "retain-on-failure",
   },
   ```

3. **Monitor payload sizes**: Enable verbose logging to see actual payload sizes:
   ```typescript
   reporter: [
     ["stanterprise-playwright-reporter", { verbose: true }],
   ],
   ```

The reporter will log warnings when attachments exceed the size limit and automatically skip their content while preserving metadata.

### Connection Issues

If you see gRPC connection errors:

1. Verify the gRPC server is running and accessible
2. Check the `grpcAddress` configuration
3. Ensure firewall rules allow the connection
4. Enable verbose logging to see detailed error messages

### Reporter Not Working

1. Verify the reporter is properly configured in `playwright.config.ts`
2. Check that `grpcEnabled` is not set to `false`
3. Look for error messages in the test output
4. Try with `verbose: true` to see detailed logs
